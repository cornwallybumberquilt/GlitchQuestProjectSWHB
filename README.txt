README
added changes to the 5 classes included, along with the new sound effects, and their needed methods. Basically all you should have to do is overwrite the current classes with these ones and it should all function as long as the sound files are correctly implemented. Just put the new sound files, (BlipDeath, EnemyDeath, and BossDeath) into your current sounds file and it should run. I didn't know how to implement EnemyDeath because i couldn't find the event handler for it, but We can just add that tomorrow before the final turn in. The changes included here also fixed the issue where it played sounds way faster than the game updates. It now only plays sounds when blip ACTUALLY does something, instead of it looping each action's sound 4-8 times based on game speed, lol
